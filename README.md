 Housing Price Prediction

This project is part of my CodeClause Data Science Internship. It focuses on predicting housing prices based on various features using machine learning algorithms.

Objective

To build a model that can accurately predict the price of a house using factors like area, number of rooms, location, etc.

Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

Dataset

- Source: Random dataset
- Features: Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Location, etc.
- Target: Price of the house

Workflow

1. Data Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Selection  
4. Model Building (Linear Regression, Random Forest)  
5. Evaluation using R² Score and MAE  

Result

- Best Performing Model: Random Forest Regressor  
- R² Score: 0.89  
- MAE: ₹1.2 lakh (example)

Future Scope

- Add more advanced models  
- Deploy using Streamlit or Flask  
- Use real-time data APIs
